===Demo 1 ===
Demo one server code will load all the flv files in the top level of the streams directory and use them to create a global feed for all live flv streams you target with the client.

The client shows how to create a resource, a proxy , and attach the underlying netstream to a video object.

In version 1.0, Audio / Video mixed in with user script-data is not optimized. To integrate A/V streams, the epoch of the output and input media must be closely monitored, or the a/v may stutter. This demo gives you a starting point.
