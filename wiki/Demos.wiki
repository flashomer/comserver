= Version 1.0 =

Note: The java jar is not included in the demo folders.

===Demo 1 ===
Demo one server code will load all the flv files in the top level of the streams directory and use them to create a global feed for all live flv streams you target with the client.

The client shows how to create a resource, a proxy , and attach the underlying netstream to a video object.

In version 1.0, Audio / Video mixed in with user script-data is not optimized. To integrate A/V streams, the epoch of the output and input media must be closely monitored, or the a/v may stutter. This demo gives you a starting point.
===Demo 2 ===
Demo two client code shows how to send messages and configure the flv buffer. The server code shows how to use the room ticker feed which broadcasts node data, and also how to configure metadata for the resource streams. The room ticker code is inside the framework source.
===Demo 3 ===
Demo 3 includes only flash code and can run on the demo 2 server code. It shows how you might add shared objects to the mix.
===Demo 4 ===
Pass the Mic! Video conference sample using shared objects to control which client live stream is viewed in a singular comserver Resource stream. The java demo shows a bit of the IConnectionNode usage. The flex demo passes a flex form-document as node data.
Requires camera and microphone for broadcast, or requires you to disable device access to view stream without.
===Demo 5 ===
Uses a Jinngine physics based stream feed, with away3dlite flash rendering to create a shared physics simulation. The data is delivered to the clients through the comserver flv stream in real time. The view of the simulation is synchronized between clients and based of their flv stream buffer length. The server-demo does not use a global feed, so every unique stream name in every room you create at run-time will be it's own simulation. Only a stream's own subscribers will be sharing that particular stream's physics simulation. When a client closes the browser, the node data shape is also removed. When new clients join, their shape is added to the stream sim. 

Update: Rotation angles fixed, and server side Jinngine api usage corrected.
